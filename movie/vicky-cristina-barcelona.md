1. Woody Allen's point of view on love 
- even two ppl are meant to be, have the same taste, match the way they see things etc... they will have conflict when living togther in after the honeymoon, feel different to face each other as there is some tiny ingredient missing, a 1 to 1 love relationship doesn't work, adding one more person having the same mind set may be the cure, a precious tiny ingredient to complete the relationship.
- in short if two ppl have to spent all the time to only one person, that will fade the feeling of love away

2. idealy relationship amoung those 3 ppl, they love each others, gender doesn't matter.
3. remind me Professor Marston and the Wonder Women
