#### Vicky Cristina Barcelona
**Watched on 19 Sep 2019**

**Movie Info from Rotten Tomato:**  
Vicky (Rebecca Hall) and Cristina (Scarlett Johansson), these two young Americans spend a summer in Spain and meet a flamboyant artist Antonio (Javier Bardem) and his beautiful but insane ex-wife Elena (Penelope Cruz). Vicky is straight-laced and about to be married. Cristina is a sexually adventurous free spirit. When they all become amorously entangled, both comedic and harrowing results ensue.

**My Opinion**  
In "Vicky Cristina Barcelona", Woody Allen hypothesized why even the meant-to-be couple cannot stay together when time goes by, there is a line from Antonio to Cristina which keeps me thinking, 

"love requires such a perfect balance. It's... like the human body. It may turn that you have all the vitamins and minerals, but if... there is minus a single, tiny ingredient... missing, like, like, like, like, ooh, like salt, for example... one dies."

So, what is the salt in terms of love? The answer pops out when Antonio, Cristina and Elena live together for some weeks, Cristina's appearance completes the balance of love.  It implicates that a strict 1 to 1 relationship will kill the feeling of love as the couple has conflict eventually. If the relationship is composed of 3 or more people who can truly love each others, it may retain the feeling. 

I think the majority of people cannot accept this idea, how can you fight with jealousy when seeing your lover kissing the others? To be honest, I may go mad! To last a long-term relationship,I think "Only Lovers Left Alive" shows a more acceptable way to me.
