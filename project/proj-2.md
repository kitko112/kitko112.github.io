**Hair Logics** is a Hong Kong-based solan, it locates at Tsim Sha Tsui and is comprised of professional hair stylist.
They need a system to store the customer information, record the transaction history, and calculate the redemption point and usage.

I developed a simple MS access file, which served the basic CRUD.
