**Heart Sell Ltd** is a Hong Kong-based store, it helps customer purchase products from oversea, their business model works because there are lots of fabulous goods not for retail in Hong Kong. Their strategy is to attract teen audience, so most of the products are related to latest trendy fashion. 
This website push Heart Sell into a higher level as they are not only serving Hong Kong customers, but also customers from different regions.

My friend and I built the whole website together, I was responsible for the UI with responsive style. And it was developed with Angular JS.
